        <p>
            I am a Phd student working in statistical shape modelling at <a href="http://wwwen.uni.lu/snt" target="_blank">University of 
            Luxembourg</a>. Prior to that, I got my MSc from <a =href="">Jacobs University Bremen</a> and BSc from <a href = "">
            Hawassa University</a>.

        <h3> Research</h3>
        <p align = "justify">  
         Currently, I am  working on representation and modelling of curved shapes/surfaces embedded in n-dimensional vector space.
         However, I have a general and strong interest in machine learning, mathematical modelling and in geometry and invariance.

        <h3>Fun with Geometery</h3>
        <p> I have a collection of matlab and python scripts, written solely for fun. The scripts are implementations of problems and wonders
            of geometery discussed in David Mumford's book <a href="http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/mumford/beyond/indra.html" target="_blank">Indra's Pearls</a>; 
            I will upload the scripts once i find the time to make them presentable. If you are interested in this sort of things 
            i recommed you to look at <a href="http://www.math.ucr.edu/home/baez/README.html" target="_blank">this</a>.
